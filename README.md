INSTALL - GOOGLE CHROME
-----------------------

* Download the [arte-downloader.user.js](../../raw/master/arte-downloader.user.js) file on your computer.

* Open Google Chrome browser and go to the extension page at: __chrome://extensions__

* Simply drag and drop the ``arte-downloader.user.js`` file on this page.


INSTALL - FIREFOX
-------------------------

* Download and Install [Arte+7 Downloader.xpi](../../raw/master/Arte+7 Downloader.xpi) locally.

[INSTALL - Opera](http://www.opera.com/docs/userjs/using/#writingscripts)
-------------------------
To enable User JavaScript:
* For Mac, go to: Opera menu > Preferences > Advanced > Content > JavaScript options
* For UNIX and Windows, go to: O menu > Settings > Preferences > Advanced > Content > JavaScript options

Select the directory where you will put your [Arte+7 Downloader.js](../../raw/master/Arte+7_Downloader.js). Opera will load the file in the specified directory whose names end with .js and will use it as a User JavaScript file. If a file name ends with .user.js it will be assumed to use Greasemonkey notation, and the load will occur after the page load which will be longer by several minutes.

USAGE
-----

Go to a video on [ARTE+7 website](http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/plus7) and you should see 3 buttons under the video:

* Download **High** Quality
* Download **Standard** Quality
* Download **Low** Quality

Then, put your cursor over a button to get more details.

You can also go on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/plus7) to see if a video got archived. This script will enable you to watch them.

FAQ
---

**Why should I use this script?**

If you are like me, and often travel with poor Internet connections, this allows you to easily download ARTE+7 videos and watch them later.

**Why ARTE+7?**

ARTE channel is an amazing place for culture. I don't have a TV at home and ARTE+7 is my only way to watch those programs after they've been live.
