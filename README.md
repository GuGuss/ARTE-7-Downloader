FAQ

**Why should I use this script?**

If you are like me, and often travel with poor Internet connections, this allows you to easily download ARTE+7 videos and watch them later.

**Why ARTE+7?**

ARTE channel is an amazing place for culture. I don't have a TV at home and ARTE+7 is my only way to watch those programs after they've been live.
